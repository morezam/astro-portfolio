excerpt: About Mohammadreza Hamzehei
---

Hello! My name is Mohammadreza Hamzehei and I'm a front-end web developer. I live in Iran and in a small village. During covid time and quarantine I started learning English and because of this new knowledge I could choose between a lot of categories to start a career. I remembered when I was 14 I created a really simple website (not live just in my PC) with HTML and notepad!. It was really fun. I showed it to all my friends and family. It wasn't live so they had to come to our home. But because of living in a small village ,the weakness of our PC and the monster of Konkur (a type of Competitive examination that we have to take it in order to get into the college) I didn't pursue it. I went to college in a field that it was not what I like. I didn't know what I like. Like many other students in Iran.

During Covid-19 quarantine and virtual learning they sent us home. And it was the beginning of my journey in front-end development. I had a lot of time so I started to learn English. I wanted to improve my English so I started to reading Medium articles. I came across many articles that told the same thing. You have to use the quarantine opportunity to start something. Learn something. I decided to learn JavaScript.

Just to be clear I did not start with JavaScript itself. Like a lot of front-end developers I started with HTML and CSS. Then JavaScript. I created small projects with these three. Then the fun began with JavaScript libraries. React.

Since then I'm learning every single day. I love learning. I want to learn better to teach better. I have plans to introduce programming to the children in my village. Because internet is not enough. Yes, a lot of developers especially in our field learnt from the internet. But, it is different in small places especially in a country like Iran. The environment is preparing you to have 3 to 5 normal jobs in the area. But many youth including myself don't like these kinda jobs. So, I wanna find them and help them.

I would love to work in an environment that I can learn how to be a team and expand my knowledge in development field. I like to help a company that is avid to help me. I only want to grow as a developer and help other people with technology. This is my passion in life.
