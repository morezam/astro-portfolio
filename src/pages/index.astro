				Hello! My name is Mohammadreza Hamzehei and I'm a front-end web
				developer. I live in Iran and in a small village. During covid time and
				quarantine I started learning English and because of this new knowledge
				I could choose between a lot of categories to start a career. I
				remembered when I was 14 I created a really simple website (not live
				just in my PC) with HTML and notepad!. It was really fun. I showed it to
				all my friends and family.
