## Overview

It's a really simple Landing page.I build it with a design file. This design file provided pictures, colors and fonts and a screenshot of the final product. I wanted to use styled-components so I create this.

## Tech Stack

I coud have used vanilla Js for creating this but for experiencing with React and Styled-components I used React.

### Front-End

It's really simple and uses React and styled-components for styling.
