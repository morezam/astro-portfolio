## Overview

It's a really simple flip-card game. I sometimes go to the website and play the game.

## Tech Stack

This project is written with vanilla JavaScript.

### Front-End

As I siad above it does not have any dependency and uses good old JavaScript. It also uses html and css for structuring and styling.
