## Overview

This app is frontend app that people can get the latest football results from. I am mad about football so I create a minimal football results app with all the infos I want :)). It has football leagues that I follow. It shows some information about each match too. Like lineups, previous matches, events (like yellow and red cards, goal scorers and ...) and statistics after match finished.

## Tech Stack

This project is front-end and it uses an api to get the football data:

### Front-End

In font-end part of the app I used NextJS with typescript. Typescript was really helpful. I used react-query which is really great library and it's handling data fetching and caching in my app.I used axios in combination with react-query to fetch data from the api. For styling I used CSS Modules.
